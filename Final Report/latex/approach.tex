\section*{Proposed Approach}


This is a supervised learning classification task, where each instance represents the tweet
by a particular governor and the label is either \texttt{‘Republican’} or \texttt{‘Democrat’}. 
We will start by making a database of tweets published by governors from all 50 states. 
Tweets relating to coronavirus will be determined by searching for keywords and hashtags pertaining to the virus, such as
\texttt{‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘pandemic’, ‘lockdown’,} etc. We will consider tweets within a fixed
time range, starting from the date of the first reported U.S. case. We will use a combination of
the \texttt{COVID-19} tweets datasets~\cite{781w-ef42-20, kaggle} as well as tweets that we scrape using the \texttt{Twitter API}~\cite{api}.
We will also need to assign party labels by scraping the name, state, and party from Wikipedia.
To allow comparison between multiple models and hyperparamters, we will split the database into training, validation and test sets with the following ratios: \texttt{70\% train, 15\% validation, 15\% test}. We will then use the best performing model to classify the tweets obtained from a separate database constituting the tweets from major US news outlets.
